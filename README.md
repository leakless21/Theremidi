In this video, I am going to show you the Theremidi, a DIY MIDI Theremin, made using an Arduino Pro Micro!

The Theremin was one of the first electronic musical instruments invented in history, by Leo Theremin. It consists of a synthesizer that uses two antennas as capacitive sensors, which track the position of the player's hands, controlling the volume and the pitch. 

However, playing a Theremin is super hard, it requires a lot of practice, and it is very expensive. So, why not have something similar but way cheaper and way easier to play? That's what I did, I created my own MIDI Theremin!

The Theremidi uses two infrared distance sensors, instead of capacitive antennas, and can track the position of your hands in the air. This position is then converted into MIDI notes, or pitch bend - right hand, or MIDI CC - left hand.

There's also an OLED display and some buttons that allow you to change octave, transpose, MIDI channel, and switch between scales and pitch bend!
